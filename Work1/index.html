    <p>Royal Enfield brought the affordable adventure touring motorcycle – the Himalayan 411 – in India in 2016. Since then, the fraternity has exploded and thousands of riders have traversed the country on this bike. However, a year later, in 2017, is when the company decided to start working on a newer Himalayan – the Himalayan 450. This motorcycle boasts several firsts for Royal Enfield.</p>

    <p>Royal Enfield always likes to keep things simple when it comes to the overall styling of their motorcycles. With the new Himalayan, the brand has stuck to the rugged and versatile roots of the Himalayas. The design approach is unique, but it still borrows some cues from the 411, like the circular headlamp and the metal frame connecting the fuel tank to the headlamp unit. </p>

    <p>The Himalayan 452 is the most modern motorcycle in Royal Enfield's line-up today, and that's because there are many modern equipments that have gone into making this ADV tourer long-distance-friendly. The highlight of this section is the 4-inch circular instrument cluster, which is a colour TFT. This console has been designed keeping long-distance and city riding in mind. Other than showing the usual ride details it also shows navigation, ambient temperature, and riding modes. Interestingly, this cluster can also show information in both analogue and digital format by pressing the mode button on the switch gear. All these selections must be done using a toggle and home buttons placed on the left side of the switchgear.</p>

    <p>The Himalayan 450 gets a brand new 452cc, single-cylinder, liquid-cooled engine. This motor makes 40bhp at 8,000rpm and 40Nm at 5,500rpm. However, it could only produce around 28-29bhp due to the high altitude of the testing grounds. As a result of this, there were some performance limitations. The engine feels and sounds relatively smooth. Unlike the Himalayan 411, it doesn't have the crudeness, and the overall NVH is well under control.</p>
